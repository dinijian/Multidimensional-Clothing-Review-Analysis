# Multidimensional-Clothing-Review-Analysis

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. In this project, we attempt to analyze the customer reviews on women clothing e-commerce by employing statistical analysis and sentiment classification. We first analyze the non-text review features (e.g. Age groups that are likely to recommend the clothing line. , The probability of a clothing line with high ratings getting recommended class of dress purchased, etc.) found in the dataset, as an attempt to unravel any connection between them and customer recommendation on the product. Then, we implement a random forest model for classifying whether a review text recommends the purchased product or not.
